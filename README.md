# force-plate-calibration
Use motion capture &amp; instrumented pole to calibrate 6-axis force plates &amp; force treadmills

Goal: Produce an instructables-style tutorial showing what is needed and how to perform calibration, along with code and some sample data.

Here are examples of instructables guides: [Instrument calibration](https://www.instructables.com/Atlas-Scientific-EZO-EC-Calibration-Procedure/) and [Flowmeter calibration](https://www.instructables.com/Calibration-of-Flowmeters-Matthew-Mota/). 

Things to do:
1. Photos and video of procedure
2. List of equipment with brief descriptions of what and why
3. Step-by-step instructions accompanied by photos
4. Sample data for a standard set-up
5. Code that demonstrates calibration
6. Code to quantify and describe results
7. Provision for others to contribute examples for other set-ups

Presently in KuoLab we use a Bertec instrumented treadmill and two types of motion capture, PhaseSpace and OptiTrack.
