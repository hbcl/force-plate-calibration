This repository is to provide insight how to calibrate the Force-Plate (instrumented treadmills) using passive motion capture. Main steps are:
  1.	Defining the origin of treadmill /force-plate where the moments are calculated about as the origin of motion capture system (two systems origins to coincide)
  2.	Define the orientation of the instrumented pole using four markers in 3D space. The force exerted on the treadmill follows the direction of the instrumented pole.
  3.	Selecting a point on instrumented pole to define its position (x, y, z) with respect to the origin. This position constitutes a vector to calculate the forcesâ€™ momentums about the origin: M = r x F
This repository contains three folders:
  1.	Transformation Matrix: to calculate the transformation matrix based on the collected force and motion capture data (training set)
  2.	Cross validation to compare the estimate results with the test set.
  3.	Load placement sensitivity: to check the sensitivity of load estimations based on loads magnitudes and locations of loads placements.
